# AI Data Breach Detection System 🔐

This project is an AI-powered system designed to detect early signs of a data breach. By analyzing system or network activity—such as login behavior, access frequency, and user patterns—this system uses machine learning models to classify events as normal or suspicious and raise alerts accordingly.

## 🚀 Project Status

🟩 *Project started: June 2025*  
🛠️ *Currently working on: Dataset exploration and preprocessing*  
📌 *Next step: Model training and evaluation*

## 🧠 Project Objectives

- Detect early signs of data breaches using machine learning
- Analyze activity logs to find abnormal behavior
- Generate real-time alerts when suspicious activity is detected
- Build an interactive dashboard to monitor predictions
